The primary goal of this text mining project was to analyze social media posts related to European elections in France. 
By examining the content on Twitter and Facebook, we aimed to understand the public discourse, key themes, sentiment, 
and influential factors shaping the conversation around these elections.

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning: Removal of irrelevant data, spam, and advertisements.

Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form for uniform analysis.

Sentiment Analysis:
Utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of each post.
Employed algorithms like VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for precise sentiment scoring
